# Lesson 6.2 Practice: XHR vs. Fetch, Get Requests, & Promises

## Directions
Respond to written responses directly in this markdown file. Use `practice.js` for coding challenge solutions.

**1. Which portion of this URL is the query string? What is the purpose of the query string in this particular example?**
  `'https://itunes.apple.com/search?artist=Janelle%20MonÃ¡e'`
 - The query string starts where there's a question mark, where you input a specific artist. It comes in handy when you're looking for something specific in a webpage. It also comes in handy as a shortcut.

**2. Reference the code snippet below. Why would an engineer decide to create the higher order function `sendHttpRequest()` and then invoke it within `getData()` and `sendData()`?

	```javascript
	const sendHttpRequest = (method, url, data) => {
		return fetch(url, {
			method: method,
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
			/*Read more about the conditional operator below (condtion ? expressionA : expression B) via MDN documenation*/
			headers: data ? { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } : {}
		}).then(response => {
			if (response.status >= 400) {
				// !response.ok
				return response.json().then(errResData => {
					const error = new Error('Something went wrong!');
					error.data = errResData;
					throw error;
				});
			}
			return response.json();
		});
	};

	const getData = () => {
		sendHttpRequest('GET', 'https://reqres.in/api/users').then(responseData => {
			console.log(responseData);
		});
	};

	const sendData = () => {
		sendHttpRequest('POST', 'https://reqres.in/api/register', {
			email: 'eve.holt@reqres.in'
			password: 'pistol'
		})
			.then(responseData => {
				console.log(responseData);
			})
			.catch(err => {
				console.log(err, err.data);
			});
	};
	```
- It looks like it's a helpful way to keep track of what exactly you're doing with the information. Whether you're getting or posting information, the function makes it clear what you intend to do with it, where it goes or comes from, and you can specify the data if you want as well, otherwise it will post or get that information. It also does checks for the data types, and has responses for resolves and rejections.

//sets it up so you can do it once, DRY

**3. Reference the code snippet in Exercise #2. What is the purpose of conditionally rendering the headers key value within the `fetch` call in the `sendHttpRequest()` function?**
- To make sure that the data exists, if you were to post something. If you're using get, then it will not return any data.

**4. In our `sendHTTPRequest` method above, we check for a `response.status` of 400 in our first callback function. Why do we have to check for this in a `then` method? Why can't we just handle 400 statuses with a `catch` method.**
- Sometimes a 400 type status could be a valid and even desired response for data. It will also help when figuring out why you recieve a certain response, such as not having access to the data, by accessing the data.

// gonna view it as a response, so you can send proper error response. basically says i got something back, you wont know what the status is until you check. helps for debugging

**5. Reference the Advice Slip API's [Random Advice endpoint](https://api.adviceslip.com/#endpoint-random). Write a function, `getRandomAdvice`, which logs a piece of random advice to the console. Make sure you include error handling. Include helpful messages or labels to clearly distinguish your log statement's response object, data object, and piece of advice or other messages. Be sure to check your solution in the console.**
- create and throw your own error, using new error object. wont always come back as json, so parsing it might help. add data property to object, store it in object, return object with new error

**6. Reference the Advice Slip API's [Advice by id endpoint](https://api.adviceslip.com/#endpoint-id). Write a function, `getSpecificAdvice`, that logs a piece of specific advice based on the id `100000`. Make sure you include error handling. Include helpful messages or labels to clearly distinguish your log statements response object, data object, and piece of advice or other messages. Look at data the helpful console log messages. Compare and contrast the response object and data object between exercise #4 and this exercise (#5). Briefly explain why the difference exists.**
-

**7. Refactor your function from exercise 5 and name it `getAdviceById`. This function should:**
	* **accept an any id as a parameter so that the function is reusable**
	* **either log a piece of advice to the console OR log that the id is not found**
	* **follow all other tips from exercise #5 regarding error handling and helpful console logs**
